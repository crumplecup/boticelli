# Session Summary - Discord Bot Command Implementation & Testing

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Phase 2 Bot Command Implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive Discord bot command infrastructure in `botticelli_social`
- ✅ Implemented 30+ Discord commands covering channels, messages, roles, emojis, webhooks, etc.
- ✅ Integrated bot commands into the narrative execution system
- ✅ Created working example narratives (publish_welcome, publish_faq, setup_channels)

### 2. Security Framework
- ✅ Created `botticelli_security` crate with policy-based permission system
- ✅ Integrated security checks into bot command execution
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting and action approval workflows

### 3. Narrative System Enhancements
- ✅ Implemented carousel feature for looped content generation
- ✅ Added nested narrative execution support
- ✅ Implemented table reference system for database content
- ✅ Added action-only acts (no LLM call required)
- ✅ Created narrative state management for persistent IDs

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Created narrative-based testing strategy for Discord commands
- ✅ Set up test harness using cargo run with feature flags
- ✅ Created first working test: `test_channels.toml`
- ⏳ Need to create remaining test narratives systematically

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with comprehensive guidelines:
  - Builder pattern preference over struct literals
  - derive_getters/derive_setters/derive_builders usage
  - Feature gate testing with cargo-hack
  - Justfile as first-class maintained document
- ✅ Added cargo-audit and omnibor-cli to CI workflow
- ✅ Fixed feature gate issues across crates
- ✅ Made diesel and database features properly optional

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Updated NARRATIVE_TOML_SPEC with carousel and table references
- ✅ Created Discord Community Server Plan
- ✅ Created Discord API Coverage Analysis
- ✅ Documented testing strategies

## Current Status

### Working Features
1. **Discord Bot Commands**: 30+ commands implemented and integrated
2. **Example Narratives**:
   - `publish_welcome.toml` - Creates welcome channel, generates content, publishes, pins
   - `publish_faq.toml` - Generates 9 FAQ questions iteratively, publishes
   - `setup_channels.toml` - Creates Discord server channel structure
3. **Carousel System**: Looped content generation with budget constraints
4. **Table References**: Query database tables in narratives
5. **Nested Narratives**: Call narratives from within narratives

### In Progress
1. **Discord Command Testing**: 
   - Test harness created
   - One test passing (test_channels)
   - Need to create remaining test narratives
2. **Feature Parity**: Discord API coverage ~60%, need more commands
3. **Message Pinning**: Works but needs act output capture system refinement

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Complete Discord Command Tests**:
   - Create test narratives for all implemented commands
   - Run full test suite
   - Fix any failing commands
   
2. **Finish Discord API Coverage**:
   - Implement remaining high-priority commands
   - Focus on: threads, forums, scheduled events, auto-moderation
   
3. **Act Output Capture**:
   - Refine system for capturing bot command outputs (message IDs, channel IDs)
   - Enable chaining commands that depend on previous outputs

### Medium Priority
4. **Persistent State Management**:
   - Implement the narrative state system for channel/message IDs
   - Avoid recreating channels on every run

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages for bot command failures
   - Better handling of permission errors
   
6. **Documentation**:
   - Create user guide for writing narratives
   - Document all available bot commands
   - Add more example narratives

### Lower Priority  
7. **Additional Platforms**:
   - Design Twitter/X bot commands
   - Design Bluesky bot commands
   - Create platform-agnostic bot trait

8. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement conversation threading
   - Add reaction-based workflows
   - Create scheduled narrative execution

## Test Execution Notes

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run Discord command tests
cargo test --test discord_command_test --features discord,api

# Run specific test
cargo test --test discord_command_test --features discord,api -- test_channels

# Run example narrative
just narrate publish_welcome
```

### Environment Variables Required
- `DISCORD_TOKEN` - Bot token
- `TEST_GUILD_ID` - Test server ID
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI generation
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string

### Known Issues
1. Test narratives take ~2 minutes to run (compiling binary each time)
2. Need better caching strategy for test runs
3. Some commands need proper permissions configured on test server

## Key Files Modified
- `crates/botticelli_social/src/discord/commands.rs` - All Discord commands
- `crates/botticelli_narrative/src/executor.rs` - Narrative execution
- `crates/botticelli_security/` - New security framework
- `CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive development guidelines
- `justfile` - Updated with new recipes
- Test narratives in `crates/botticelli_social/tests/narratives/discord/`

## Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: Added ~5000+ lines across multiple crates
- **Commands Implemented**: 30+
- **Test Coverage**: 1/30+ commands tested (need to expand)
- **Documentation**: 10+ markdown files created/updated

# Session Update - 2025-11-22

## Major Progress

### Discord Testing Infrastructure ✅
- 30+ Discord command tests with narrative-based approach
- State management for test resource lifecycle
- Comprehensive documentation (AI_NARRATIVE_TOML_GUIDE, TESTING_PATTERNS)

### Known Blockers 🔴
- Struct literal usage in table_references_test.rs (lines 25-47, 216-238, 327-349)
- Struct literal usage in gemini_test.rs files
- Must convert to builder pattern before tests will compile

### Next Steps
1. Fix table_references_test.rs struct literals (CRITICAL)
2. Fix gemini_test.rs struct literals (CRITICAL)  
3. Run `just test-all` to verify
4. Complete Discord command test coverage
