# Content Generation: Potential Discord Guilds
#
# This narrative generates potential Discord guild (server) configurations.
# Guilds are stored in a "potential_guilds" table for review and refinement.
#
# This is useful for:
# - Planning new server configurations
# - Testing guild-related features
# - Generating diverse server examples for documentation
# - Brainstorming community themes
#
# Workflow:
# 1. Run: boticelli run --narrative narratives/generate_guilds.toml
# 2. Review: boticelli content list potential_guilds
# 3. Rate servers: boticelli content tag potential_guilds 1 --rating 5 --tags "gaming,active"
# 4. Approve favorite: boticelli content review potential_guilds 1 approved
# 5. Promote to production: boticelli content promote potential_guilds 1 --target discord_guilds
#
# Run with: boticelli run --narrative narratives/generate_guilds.toml
